        <p>As both a brand strategist and copywriter I develop product and brand concepts for research that are strategically and creatively on point.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        I have created lots of product concepts over the years - for Kallo, Premier Foods, Dulux, Kraft, Diageo, Lily’s Kitchen, Dettol, M&S, and Cillit Bang to name a few.​  </li>
          <li>
      I can work with your team to develop the concepts strategically, or you can send me your workshop outputs and I can turn them into on point concepts for you. ​    </li>

    I have also been copywriting our Google search ads and Facebook Ads from the beginning and have written all our blog posts – over 250 of them – each one using key phrases that I identified through SEO research.      </li>

        <p>I recently upped my copywriting game with an SEO copywriting qualification, which I earned from the prestigious SEO Content Institute founded by Heather Lloyd Martin, the pioneer of SEO writing.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
          I love it – finding that it marries everything I love about being a brand strategist (objectives, targets, brand positioning) with the creativity of copywriting.
          </li>
          <li>
        I cut my teeth in SEO web copywriting on my own website – YogaClicks.store, increasing our organic traffic by 15% in the first month.    </li>

<li>A full SEO review includes:<br />
<ul>
  <li>Competitive analysis​</li>
    <li>Customer analysis​</li>
      <li>Per page key phrase strategy and a content plan</li>
        <li>SEO web copywriting</li>

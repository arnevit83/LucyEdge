        <p>As both a brand strategist and copywriter I develop product and brand concepts for research that are strategically and creatively on point.</p>

            Working as a freelance copywriter I have created lots of research concepts over the years - from product concepts for Premier Foods and Kallo, to brand concepts for Lily’s Kitchen and Dulux.
</li>




          <li>
      I can work with your team to develop the concepts strategically, or you can send me your workshop outputs and I can turn them into on point concepts for you. ​    </li>

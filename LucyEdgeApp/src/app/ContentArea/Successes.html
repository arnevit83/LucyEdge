          As a brand strategist my work almost always includes brand purpose. Why brands do what they do is as important as what they do and how they do it. Whether I am working on cat food or a yoga studio I always ask this question – making sure we have the answers we need to create customer trust and engagement.

         </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inspired	by	brands	like	Patagonia,	Disney,	Dove	and	Apple,	every	brand	must	ask	itself	this	question,	and	provide	some	solid	answers	to	earn	customer	trust.
          </li>
          <li>
          Lily’s	Kitchen	was	created	because	Henrietta, had	a	sick	dog	(called	Lily)	that	recovered	when	she	fed	her	proper,	natural	food.	I	had	the	job	of	extending	that	purpose	to	work	for	cats,	which	turned	out	to	be	a	purrfect (sorry)	fit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating	Dettol’s	brand	purpose	was	a	career	high	for	me.	Following	a	brand	purpose	workshop,	in	which	we	realised that	the	opportunity	lay	in	taking	Dettol	from	preventing	the	spread	of	germs	to	the	spreading	of	health,	we	were	able	to	reposition	Dettol	as	a		brand	on a	mission	for	health.

        <p>Yoga School Dropout is my first yoga book; a yoga memoir describing my personal quest for spiritual riches in the ashrams of India. A divine comedy on the Western obsession with life’s deeper meaning, a yogic experiment and, ultimately, a love letter to India.
<br /><br />After over a decade spent working and drinking too much in the world of advertising, I decided to leave town for an altogether more spiritual and, well, meaningful way of life – and whilst I was at it, I could maybe acquire a newly lithe and supple body.
<br /><br />Would I come home looking like Christy Turlington and pick up some male followers and serenity on the way? Or did something much funnier, more interesting and complicated happen? Did I fall in love – with a place and its people?
<br /><br />Yoga School Dropout has received critical acclaim as one of the best yoga books on India, and as a pioneer of yoga memoir.

          “Lucy Edge, a former London ad exec, goes in search of spiritual riches (and the perfect headstand) in India. Neither boringly cynical nor stupidly gullible, she’s open minded, warm and funny; even – though she’d be the last person to claim this – rather wise.” The Independent on Sunday, Books of the Year
          </li>
<li>“I have no interest whatsoever in yoga but nonetheless found this to be an entertaining and witty read. Lucy conjures up an evocative picture of travelling yoga enthusiasts residing in India, living and breathing their passion (along with other related pursuits) with humour and pertinent observation. Much better than Eat Pray Love. Highly recommend!” Lorna Spears</li>

The Handbag and Wellies Yoga Club is my second yoga book; this yoga memoir describes my search for friendship and fertility in the lotus position. <br /><br />

I had met the love of my life and was planning to trade my London flat for a Norfolk farmhouse, get married, and try for a baby.

But country life wasn’t quite what I imagined. Sure, there’s time to stop and chat, but where would I find the people to stop and chat to?

I had almost given up when, one day, I stumbled across a local yoga club. There – in a small room above Knit and Knatter – I found the laughter, friendship and wisdom to carry me as I struggled to win the egg and womb race.

    “From an epiphany doing a headstand to enlightenment after a glass or two of Pinot Grigio, this book draws you in as you share in the ups and downs of Lucy’s life. She proves that no matter what intentions we set and how many chants we sing or pretzel-like poses we master, the outcomes of our lives are often not in our control.” Orla        </li>
          <li>
      I was gripped and moved. Lucy Edge, the author, shows insight and takes one with her on a fascinating journey. So moving, with a bunch of intriguing characters. She writes beautifully and with a natural flow…very very human and pertinent.” Chris Roden    </li>
          <li>
      “It made me laugh, made me feel sad, but ultimately left me feeling uplifted – I was glad to be reminded of the healing power of yoga, friendship and love.” S. Sherriff      </li>

       <p>My other yoga books were both yoga memoirs - this is my first yoga novel. 

<br /><br />Stuck in Slough Meg’s going nowhere fast. Boxed in and stitched up, she jumps at the chance to work at Shine – the last word in super-luxe yoga, complete with cellulite-banishing yoga pants and high-tech yoga mats.
<br /><br />She loves putting her brand smarts into action, and her office view of the Gherkin, but when Shine threatens to shut down a small but beloved neighbourhood yoga studio, Meg’s forced to make a choice.
<br /><br />Is she a buff-bodied, fast-track corporate girl, circling the globe, dating the glamorous Max, or does her heart lie closer to home – with the granola guy up the road and her own soul-fired business.
<br /><br />Down Dog Billionaire is a heart-warming comedy of errors for any woman balancing bitchy colleagues, crazy friendships and men being men, with the never-ending temptation of chocolate.

         </p>
       <ul>
         <li>
      “This first novel does not disappoint and in fact is written with a confidence normally found in more seasoned authors. I especially like the characterisations which were believable but with a comedic twist. I’m only sorry that I read it in a day.” Alan Dolan, The Breath Guru     </li>
         <li>
           “Down Dog is a well written and refreshing take on the colourful word that is yoga, supported by dynamic characters who are full of life—an absolute delight! I have already recommended it to many of my friends. A fab read for anyone who regularly strives for a lifestyle that satisfies both their head AND their heart.” Leah Giorno
   </li>
   <li>
     “This is a witty, very astute and richly imagined portrait of the ‘underbelly’ of the yoga world – one in which yoga’s traditional roots and ethics are overlaid by values that are predominately materialistic, superficial and obsessed with appearances. I really enjoyed the whole host of characters – from Meg’s über-bitchy colleagues at Shine (the novel has echoes of The Devil Wears Prada) to Nate, the hunky but understated local teacher whose studio is threatened by Shine’s arrival – and the dynamics between all them.” Amanya

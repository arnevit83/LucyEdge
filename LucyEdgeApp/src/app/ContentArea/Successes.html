          <li>
            There	followed	a	full	brand	strategy	analysis	incl.	target	definition	&	brand	purpose,	a	copy	strategy	incl.	tone	of	voice,	and	a	social	media	strategy.

        <p>One	of	the	most	welcome	developments	in	all	my	years	as	a	Brand	Strategist	has	been	the	focus	on	Brand	Purpose.	Why	brands	do	what	they	do	has	become	as	important	as	what	they	do	and	how	they	do	it. </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Inspired	by	brands	like	Patagonia,	Disney,	Dove	and	Apple,	every	brand	must	ask	itself	this	question,	and	provide	some	solid	answers	to	earn	customer	trust.
          </li>
          <li>
            One	of	my	favourite	examples	of	a	very	personal	brand	purpose	is	Lily’s	Kitchen,	which	was	created	because	Henrietta,	its	founder,	had	a	sick	dog	(called	Lily)	that	recovered	when	she	fed	her	proper,	natural	food.	I	had	the	job	of	extending	that	purpose	to	work	for	cats,	which	turned	out	to	be	a	purrfect(sorry)	fit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating	Dettol’s	brand	purpose	was	a	career	high	for	me.	Following	a	Brand	Purpose	Workshop,	in	which	we	realised that	the	opportunity	lay	in	taking	Dettol	from	preventing	the	spread	of	germs	to	the	spreading	of	health,	we	were	able	to	reposition	Dettol	as	a		brand	with	a	social	purpose	–a	brand	on	a	mission	for	health.

        <p>Yoga School Dropout is my first yoga book; a yoga memoir describing my personal quest for spiritual riches in the ashrams of India. A divine comedy on the Western obsession with life’s deeper meaning, a yogic experiment and, ultimately, a love letter to India.
<br /><br />After over a decade spent working and drinking too much in the world of advertising, I decided to leave town for an altogether more spiritual and, well, meaningful way of life – and whilst I was at it, I could maybe acquire a newly lithe and supple body.
<br /><br />Would I come home looking like Christy Turlington and pick up some male followers and serenity on the way? Or did something much funnier, more interesting and complicated happen? Did I fall in love – with a place and its people?

<br /><br />Yoga School Dropout has received critical acclaim as one of the best yoga books on India, and as a pioneer of yoga memoir.

          “Lucy Edge, a former London ad exec, goes in search of spiritual riches (and the perfect headstand) in India. Neither boringly cynical nor stupidly gullible, she’s open minded, warm and funny; even – though she’d be the last person to claim this – rather wise.” The Independent on Sunday, Books of the Year
          </li>
<li>“I have no interest whatsoever in yoga but nonetheless found this to be an entertaining and witty read. Lucy conjures up an evocative picture of travelling yoga enthusiasts residing in India, living and breathing their passion (along with other related pursuits) with humour and pertinent observation. Much better than Eat Pray Love. Highly recommend!” Lorna Spears</li>

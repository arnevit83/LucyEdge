          As an experienced brand strategist I understand the importance of customer insight and I use a myriad of customer insight tools (segmentation, ethnography, semiotics etc.) to deepen understanding and engagement.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Johnnie	Walker	Red	customers	were	identified	as	tough	guys	who’d	maybe	smoke	a	Marlboro	Red	alongside	their	whisky,	leading	to	ad	campaigns	rooted	in	adventure	and	exploration.
          </li>
          <li>
            Sitting	with	Sainsbury’s	customers	to	observe	the	ritual	of	the	Sunday	Lunch	led	to	an	insight	around	the	handing	down	of	secret	recipes,	shortcuts	and	flavoursomehacks	as	family	heirlooms,	and	then	to	the	sharing	of	these	customer	“secrets”	instore	and	online.
          </li>
          <li>One	to	one	interviews	with	Lexus	Customer	Service	representatives	showed	me	just	how	much	of	a	competitive	advantage	their	customer	care	was	(I	now	drive	a	Lexus!)</li>
          <li>Quarterly interviews with E4 viewers kept the brand on point “for when social media sucks and it’s raining outside".
          </li>
          <li>A	qualitative	investigation	into	customer	motivation	for	Juice	Research	and	Mecca	Bingo	resulted	in	a	customer	segmentation	that	enabled	the	business	to find and	focus	on	its	most	valuable	customers.	</li>

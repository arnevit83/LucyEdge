    <p>As an experienced brand strategist I have run brand strategy training courses for lots of organisations - from research companies to ad agencies and innovations agencies.</p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                My approach is to show people that they are strategists in real life  - that choosing which restaurant to go to, or where to go on holiday, requires a strategy.
               </li>
                          <li>
                            This way of thinking is then applied to case studies and real life brand issues and everyone finds out that â€“ hey presto - they are a natural born brand strategist.

                </li>

            </ul><br/>

              Brand strategy training courses increase staff confidence in their ability to solve strategic issues, and create better brand strategies!

The Handbag and Wellies Yoga Club is my second yoga book; this yoga memoir describes my search for friendship and fertility in the lotus position.
<br /><br />
I had met the love of my life and was planning to trade my London flat for a Norfolk farmhouse, get married, and try for a baby.

But country life wasn’t quite what I imagined. Sure, there’s time to stop and chat, but where would I find the people to stop and chat to?

I had almost given up when, one day, I stumbled across a local yoga club. There – in a small room above Knit and Knatter – I found the laughter, friendship and wisdom to carry me as I struggled to win the egg and womb race.

    “From an epiphany doing a headstand to enlightenment after a glass or two of Pinot Grigio, this book draws you in as you share in the ups and downs of Lucy’s life. She proves that no matter what intentions we set and how many chants we sing or pretzel-like poses we master, the outcomes of our lives are often not in our control.” Orla        </li>

      I was gripped and moved. Lucy Edge, the author, shows insight and takes one with her on a fascinating journey. So moving, with a bunch of intriguing characters. She writes beautifully and with a natural flow…very very human and pertinent.” Chris Roden    </li>

      “It made me laugh, made me feel sad, but ultimately left me feeling uplifted – I was glad to be reminded of the healing power of yoga, friendship and love.” S. Sherriff      </li>

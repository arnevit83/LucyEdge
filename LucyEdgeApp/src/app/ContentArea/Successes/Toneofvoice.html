      <p>I use my expertise as a brand strategist and copywriter to create a tone of voice that is both strategically and creatively on point – that has style and spark and gets your brand noticed for all the right reasons.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>As a freelance copywriter I’ve created tone of voice guidelines for a wide range of brands – from Grayling PR to my own brand, YogaClicks.
</li>
          <li>
          I worked with what I named Body Positive Works (previously the Body Image Boutique) to create a unique brand tone of voice that summed up the kick ass founders – Jen and Mel.</li>
                      <li>
        From this start I created tone of voice guidelines with example social media posts and web copy.
            </li>

        <p>Body Positive Works is now a compelling lighthouse brand that the existing community loves and that draws like-minded customers to it.</p>

        <p>I've	worked	on	dozens	of	brand	positioning	projects	as	a	brand	strategist.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I’ve	created	a	brand	positioning	map	for	Lily’s	Kitchen,	a	brand	positioning	statement	for	the	Royal	Navy,	and	brand	positioning	strategies	for	E4	and	McDonald’s	(fuelled	by	many	a	bag	of	fries).
          </li>
          <li>
            I also created the brand positioning strategy for YogaClicks – a challenging job in a crowded market.
          </li>
          <li>
            One	that	was	really	fun	was	the	map	of	the	cleaning	products	market	I	did	for	CillitBang.	It	showed	Bang	occupying	some	unique	territory	– powerful	and	strong	– for	warrior	women,	in	opposition	to	“Nambypamby”	Flash	lemon	and	beautiful	but	ineffectual	Method.
          </li>

        <p>This Cillit Bang	“bring	it	on”	positioning	inspired	a	host	of	new	product	ideas	and	packaging	which	have	added	significant	value	to	the	bottom	line.</p>

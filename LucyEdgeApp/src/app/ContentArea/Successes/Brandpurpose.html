          As a brand strategist my work almost always includes brand purpose. Why brands do what they do is as important as what they do and how they do it. Whether I am working on cat food or a yoga studio I always ask this question – making sure we have the answers we need to create customer trust and engagement.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Inspired	by	brands	like	Patagonia,	Disney,	Dove	and	Apple,	every	brand	must	ask	itself	this	question,	and	provide	some	solid	answers	to	earn	customer	trust.
          </li>
          <li>
          Lily’s	Kitchen	was	created	because	Henrietta, had	a	sick	dog	(called	Lily)	that	recovered	when	she	fed	her	proper,	natural	food.	I	had	the	job	of	extending	that	purpose	to	work	for	cats,	which	turned	out	to	be	a	purrfect (sorry)	fit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Creating	Dettol’s	brand	purpose	was	a	career	high	for	me.	Following	a	brand	purpose	workshop,	in	which	we	realised that	the	opportunity	lay	in	taking	Dettol	from	preventing	the	spread	of	germs	to	the	spreading	of	health,	we	were	able	to	reposition	Dettol	as	a		brand	on a	mission	for	health.

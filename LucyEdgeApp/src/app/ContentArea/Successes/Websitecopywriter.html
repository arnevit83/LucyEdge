        <p>I have extensive experience as a website copywriter. It all started with YogaClicks – the site I founded​.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
        In that role I have taken on every element of digital copywriting – from SEO copywriting all the webpages to email copywriting for our newsletters.  </li>
          <li>
            As a full stack web copywriter I have also been copywriting our Google search ads and Facebook ads and have written all our blog posts – over 250 of them – each one using key phrases that I identified through SEO research.

     </li>

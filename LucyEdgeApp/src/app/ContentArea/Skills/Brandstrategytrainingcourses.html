            As	an	experienced	Brand	Strategist	I	have	run	Brand	Strategy	Training	Courses	for	lots	of	organisations - from	research	companies	to	ad	agencies	and	innovations	agencies.

                      <li>
            My	approach	is	to	show	people	that	they	are	strategists	in	real	life - that	choosing	which	restaurant	to	go	to,	or	where	to	go	on	holiday,	requires	a	strategy.	They	need	clarity	on	the	experience	they	want	to	have	(their	objective),	and	to	sift	through	their	options	(strategies)	for	getting	to	that	end	goal.	This	way	of	thinking	is	then	applied	to	case	studies	and	real	live	brand	issues	and	everyone	finds	out	that	â€“ hey	presto	- they	are	a	natural	born	brand	strategist.

  Lucy is without doubt one of the best and most interesting planning directors I have worked with. She is very insightful and creative in both her thinking and presentation style, always looking to find a clear and motivational strategic consumer difference for a brand and then presenting it in a persuasive, engaging manner. On a personal basis she is extremely diligent, very hard working and gets on with almost everybody. More importantly she is a delight to have working on your team.

 Lucy brings rigorous thinking, insight and creativity to all her work. She has a great sense of what is needed to deliver against an objective and can unravel complex strategic issues with ease. She loves brands and is particularly strong at creating activist brand platforms that attract large communities of followers. She is equally good at qualitative research – with a talent for empathy, insight and analysis. Lucy is always curious and energetic, plus she’s cool under pressure – perhaps it’s all that yoga!

                          Lucy is an insightful planner. She has the ability to internalise huge amounts of information, both qualitative and quantitative, and distil it into persuasive strategies and ideas. Additionally she writes beautifully, in a compelling and flowing way that is elegant yet precise and concise. Once on the case she is relentless and totally focused, putting in more hours than anyone I know. Her thinking is fresh and human and always actionable.

                 Lucy was a pleasure to work with – she ensured everything produced was on brief, on time, and written in a way that worked for the business. But she also challenged and pushed us to be more creative and made suggestions for how we could use content across multiple channels. Lucy has extensive knowledge about all aspects of copywriting as well as understanding what’s going to have the most impact from a marketing, PR and social media perspective

                  Lucy had been recommended to us because she had extensive brand experience and experience both personally and professionally with the yoga world. In our first meeting with Lucy, she immediately and boldly told us that she felt that we should change our name. Our original name was The Body Image Boutique and she did not feel that the name properly reflected who we are. We engaged her immediately and were impressed every step of the way with her professionalism, creativity, and intelligence. She came up with alternative names for us to choose from and we decided on Body Positive Works with the tagline "The Feel Good Place." We love the name and the response from our community has been amazing. Lucy also developed a brand identity and copy strategy for us and also helped us develop our social media strategy. Working with Lucy from "across the pond" was never an issue and she was always available to us. I can't say enough about Lucy and look forward to working with her on future projects!   </div><fa-icon class="text-secondary float-right" [icon]="faQuoteRight"></fa-icon>

  I engaged Lucy on a fast-paced client project, to which she added tremendous value. She was responsible for developing a brand manifesto and script for a brand film. She delivered high quality work, was a great communicator, met all deadlines, and was overall pleasure to work with. Her knowledge in the yoga space was a huge plus for this particular client and I would highly recommend her for future projects.

I emailed Lucy first and she suggested we talk on the phone, this gave me a really good opportunity to get a feeling and the vibe was great as we spoke. I knew she was the right person for me to use. I then got work and sent Lucy over a lot of info very disorganised along with terrible grammar. It was very long, frankly a mess. Lucy condensed it down and turned it into something very beautifully written and yet with my voice in it. I’m thrilled! I’m so happy with the result and would not hesitate to ask her to do more writing for me. Thank you so much Lucy. </div><fa-icon class="text-secondary float-right" [icon]="faQuoteRight"></fa-icon>

I approached Lucy to undertake the copy for my new website as I had previously read her wonderful stories and freelance journalism, and I knew that she has the special gift of being able to convey a story with intelligence, clarity and humour. Lucy set about carefully crafting words that captured our creativity, professionalism and essence to potential clients. The resulting web copy is fabulous. Lucy’s writing and marketing skills are an asset to all enterprises searching for a unique and individual approach to the written word.     </div><fa-icon class="text-secondary float-right" [icon]="faQuoteRight"></fa-icon>

  I engaged Lucy for a day at short notice. She helped me finalise copy of a global brand positioning project. Lucy was determined to nail it and worked well into the night to hit the deadline. I’d use her again.

We engaged Lucy's services to help write our own brand manifesto. She helped channel our thinking and really understood what we wanted to say. We loved it so much we made it into a video.

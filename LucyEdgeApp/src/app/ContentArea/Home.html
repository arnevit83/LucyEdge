  As a fellow business owner (the yoga shop <a target="_blank" href="http://www.yogaclicks.store">YogaClicks.store</a>) I know the demands of running a business – I know that you need it done right, done yesterday, and done on budget.<br /><br />
  In case you need a book author… I am also the author of three yoga books, including the yoga memoir Yoga School Dropout.

          I combine my many years of advertising agency experience and love of the transformative power of yoga, to offer web copywriting and SEO copywriting, along with branding and marketing coaching, to yoga teachers, retreats and studios.

              Lucy has real empathy for, and understanding of, a yoga teachers’ challenges
              around marketing their yoga classes and retreats. 
              <br/><br/>
              Being coached by Lucy and digging down on my purpose, values, wants and needs
              has been a valuable reboot to my yoga business. 
              <br/><br/>
              I needed this encouragement and support to bring focus and re-energise. 
              <br/><br/>
              Lucy’s approach has been a breath of fresh air; fun and at the same time on point
              and incisive. Her branding expertise, and entrepreneurial savvy, adding so much
              value to the conversation. 
              <br/><br/>
              The structure and ongoing summaries provided me with much needed direction.
              These sessions have helped me to find my teaching voice and confidence in this
              expanding and increasingly competitive market place.

              I worked with Lucy to help me turn my vague ideas of establishing a yoga and
              coaching business into a concrete plan.
              <br/><br/>
              Lucy certainly knows her stuff! She is very knowledgeable and supportive and
              provides guidance through the process step-by-step.
              <br/><br/>
              She takes into consideration your own personal life situation to ensure your yoga
              marketing plans are achievable for you.  
              <br/><br/>
              Working with Lucy has helped me gain clarity on my overall purpose for the yoga
              business I want to create, and the yoga students I want to serve.
              <br/><br/>
              She has injected me with a new excitement and enthusiasm about the possibilities.
              <br/><br/>
              I highly recommend working with Lucy.

                Lucy had been recommended to us because she had extensive brand experience and experience both personally and professionally with the yoga world. <br/><br/>In our first meeting with Lucy, she immediately and boldly told us that she felt that we should change our name. <br/><br/>Our original name was The Body Image Boutique and she did not feel that the name properly reflected who we are. We engaged her immediately and were impressed every step of the way with her professionalism, creativity, and intelligence. She came up with alternative names for us to choose from and we decided on Body Positive Works with the tagline "The Feel Good Place." <br/><br/>We love the name and the response from our community has been amazing. Lucy also developed a brand identity and copy strategy for us and also helped us develop our social media strategy. <br/><br/>Working with Lucy from "across the pond" was never an issue and she was always available to us. I can't say enough about Lucy and look forward to working with her on future projects!

                I emailed Lucy first and she suggested we talk on the phone, this gave me a really good opportunity to get a feeling and the vibe was great as we spoke.<br /><br /> I knew she was the right person for me to use. <br /><br />I then got work and sent Lucy over a lot of info very disorganised along with terrible grammar. It was very long, frankly a mess. <br /><br />Lucy condensed it down and turned it into something very beautifully written and yet with my voice in it. I’m thrilled! I’m so happy with the result and would not hesitate to ask her to do more writing for me. <br /><br />Thank you so much Lucy.

              Lucy is a pro! <br /><br /> She was able to streamline my jumbled ideas into a clear, marketable message.  <br /><br />
              She understands the yoga and meditation industry and walks the path.  <br /><br />
              It was a joy to work with her and I absolutely recommend her.

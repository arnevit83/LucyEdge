          Uncomfortable with the idea of marketing yourself as a yoga teacher? Don’t know how to market a yoga studio? Learn how to love marketing, differentiate yourself, and find new students. 
          <br /><br />
          I combine my many years of advertising agency experience and love of the transformative power of yoga, to offer web copywriting and SEO copywriting, along with branding and marketing coaching, to yoga teachers, retreats and studios.

          As a fully qualified SEO copywriter (with the prestigious SEO Content Institute), I create engaging on-point web copy which will attract the students you seek to serve and help you climb the Google page rankings. Whether you’re a lone yoga teacher who wants an “About” page, or an established yoga studio needing forty pages on your services and expertise, I can help.

            Lucy is without doubt one of the best and most interesting planning directors I have worked with. She is very insightful and creative in both her thinking and presentation style, always looking to find a clear and motivational strategic consumer difference for a brand and then presenting it in a persuasive, engaging manner. On a personal basis she is extremely diligent, very hard working and gets on with almost everybody. More importantly she is a delight to have working on your team.
